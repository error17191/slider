calculate free horizontal space on each side: w
get the smaller image width : ws

if ws/2 > w then show w only of it and 2 of the larger image
else then show ws/2 of it and ws/2 of the larger image

the left of the right one will be
	left of the center - its width + 5

the left of the right one will be
	left of the center + center width - 5
